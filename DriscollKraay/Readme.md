Julia code for panel regressions with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors

As of October 2024, I recommend to use the panel regression routines in 
my repository Financial Econometrics (https://github.com/PaulSoderlind/FinancialEconometrics) instead,
in particular, the functions in `PanelOls.jl`. 
They are quicker, more versatile (fixed effects) and handle unbalanced panels better. 

I plan to update the example previously posted here to use those routines.
